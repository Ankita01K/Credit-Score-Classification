# Credit-Score-Classification with Machine Learning.

credit score is a numerical representation of a person's creditworthiness based on their credit history, income, and other financial factors. It is a critical factor for lenders and credit card companies when deciding whether to approve a loan or extend credit. A credit score ranges from 300 to 850, with higher scores indicating better creditworthiness. A good credit score is typically above 700, while a score below 600 is considered poor.

There are three credit scores that banks and credit card companies use to label their customers:

1-Good

2-Standard

3-Poor

In this project, I showcase my skills in creating and assessing machine learning models. The project's objective is to accurately predict a person's credit score by considering their financial background and personal details. I've executed the project within a Colab Notebook, using **Python** and well-known **machine learning libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.** and evaluate several different machine learning models.
